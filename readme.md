# Listen up you fucking skidders.
- This Took me a lot to make, please don't even try skidding this for the god sake
- "THEN DONT MAKE IT OPEN SOURCE!!!!" It's not that, my projects are like popular because they support every executor, that's why i always open source them.
- If you are really gonna steal it, hope you burn yourself in a fire.
- I might as well discontinue this forever if someone just copies the source and attract more people.
